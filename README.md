<h1>Flutter Fowl</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
Project is a simple game similar to Flappy Bird that I created using the C# coding language and the Unity software. It utilizes many functions of Unity, including game scripting, collision functions, position functions, sprite rendering, canvas functions, and more. Utilized WebGL, a JavaScript API, to allow this game to be rendered and played online.
